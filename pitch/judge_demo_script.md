# 60–75s Judge Demo Script
**Hook (5s):** “Most teams waste LLM spend because every request hits the expensive model.”
**Problem (10s):** “Easy tasks don’t need reasoning models—costs spike, latency drags.”
**Solution (10s):** “RAD AI routes each request: FAST for simple, REASONING for hard.”
**Live (25s):**
- Paste a simple FAQ → FAST route returns answer quickly.
- Paste a multi-step reasoning prompt → REASONING route.
- Scroll to the log table: show latency + est_cost_usd delta.
**Proof (15s):** “In our runs, cheap tasks bypass the pricey model—logs capture tokens, latency, and cost.”
**Close (5s):** “This saves 30–60% on day one. Want a 10-min walkthrough?”
