# Deck Outline (4 min)
1. Hook (10s): costly LLM bills / slow responses
2. Problem (30s): wrong model for task; wasted $, latency, inconsistent quality
3. Solution (45s): RAD AI router (FAST vs REASONING) + simple policy
4. Demo (60s): live app, show one query each route, reveal log & cost delta
5. Evidence (30s): CSV logs, timestamps, quick KPI (cost ↓30–60%)
6. Biz Model (25s): usage-based + SLA; start with dev teams & agencies
7. Moat (20s): routing data flywheel; eval harness; vendor-agnostic
8. Ask (20s): pilots + intros; plan next milestones

## Q&A Backpocket
- Pricing assumptions, failure modes, eval plan, fallback if APIs down.
