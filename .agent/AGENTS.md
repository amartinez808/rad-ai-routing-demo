# ExecPlans  
When implementing complex features or significant refactors, create and follow an ExecPlan. ExecPlans are documented in `.agent/PLANS.md` and provide a living, self-contained design doc that guides work from start to finish. They ensure anyone — human or AI — can understand the context and complete the tasks autonomously.  

Developers should place each ExecPlan in `.agent/execplans/<feature-name>.md` and update the plan's progress, discoveries, decisions and outcomes as work proceeds.
